The ArtAuth Project utilizes deep learning models to classify artworks as either human-made or AI-generated. This repository contains the implementation of several deep learning architectures: a base model developed from scratch, fine-tuned AlexNet, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB3 models. These models are trained and evaluated on a dataset comprising human-created and AI-generated artworks.

Artificial intelligence has increasingly played a role in creating artworks that challenge traditional definitions of art. The ArtAuth Project aims to classify artworks into two categories: those created by humans and those generated by AI algorithms. By leveraging deep learning models, we seek to distinguish between these categories based on visual characteristics and patterns inherent in the artworks.

Models Implemented
The following deep learning models are implemented and evaluated in this project:

Base Model (from scratch): Custom deep learning architecture designed specifically for this classification task.
AlexNet (Fine-tuned): Fine-tuned version of the AlexNet architecture, a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) originally designed for image classification.
EfficientNetB0: EfficientNetB0 model, optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency, fine-tuned for the ArtAuth classification task.
EfficientNetB3: Larger variant of the EfficientNet family, offering improved performance over EfficientNetB0, also fine-tuned for the classification task.
Each model is trained on a dataset comprising images of human-made artworks and AI-generated artworks, with the goal of achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between the two categories.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, downloaded from Kaggle, consists of images categorized into two classes:

Human-Made Art: Images of artworks created by human artists.
AI-Made Art: Images generated by artificial intelligence algorithms, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other AI art generation techniques.
The dataset is organized into separate directories for each class, facilitating easy access and preprocessing prior to model training.
